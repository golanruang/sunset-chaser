Sunset chaser is an app made to notify users when there will be a nice sunset in the area using weather forecast data. 

Using weather data, sunset chaser will predict how nice a sunset will be for a user in a given area. Then, if the user has notifications turned on, 
the app will notify a user that there is predicted to be a nice sunset. 


### Priority 0 (MVP) Features

- **Location Input**: Users can input and save their location for sunset predictions
- **Sunset Probability**: Given a user's location, the app returns the day's probability of having a nice sunset
- **Smart Notifications**: 1 hour before sunset, if particularly nice sunset attributes are identified, users receive a notification

### Future Features (Priority 1+)

- **Sunset Quality Scoring**: Numerical rating system (1-10) for sunset quality
- **Weather Integration**: Real-time weather data from reliable APIs
- **User Preferences**: Customizable notification timing and sunset quality thresholds
- **Sunset Gallery**: Users can share and view photos of predicted vs actual sunsets
- **Multiple Locations**: Save and monitor multiple favorite sunset viewing spots
- **Sunrise Alerts**: Extend functionality to include sunrise predictions

### Technical Stack Considerations
- **Frontend**: React Native
- **Backend**: Golang Gin 
- **Database**: Supabase 
- **Notifications**: Chrome extension notifications
- **Location Services**: GPS integration and geocoding

## User Experience Flow
1. User opens app and inputs their location
2. App displays current day's sunset probability and time
3. 1 hour before sunset, if conditions are favorable, user receives notification
4. User can view detailed weather conditions contributing to the prediction

## Success Metrics
- User engagement: Daily active users checking sunset predictions
- User retention: Users who continue using the app over time
